## 0.13.1 (September 13th, 2012)

Patch Release

Bug Fixes

 - Make the prepend and append filters use the empty string if passed undefined (#543)
 - Fix a bug with InsertionBinding throwing DOM exceptions if the bound keypath changed from a falsy value to another falsy value. (#512)
 - Fix a bug with the solo build throwing errors on load due to a missing semicolon with reqwest. (#552)

## 0.13.0 (September 11th, 2012)

Major Release

Breaking Changes:

 - Removed top level DOM helpers from the `Batman` namespace and moved them to the `Batman.DOM` namespace. The moved helpers are `setInnerHTML`, `propagateBindingEvent`, `propagateBindingEvents`, `trackBinding`, `onParseExit`, `forgetParseExit`, `setStyleProperty`, `destroyNode`, `removeOrDestroyNode`, `insertBefore`, `addEventListener`, `removeEventListener`, `hasAddEventListener`, `preventDefault`, `stopPropagation`, and `appendChild`.
 - Moved the DOM helpers which could be expressed using platform specific code into the platform adapters. This means that `Batman.DOM.setInnerHTML` will use `jQuery.fn.html` when using the jQuery platform adapter and the old implemention when using `solo`. Affected helpers are `querySelector`, `querySelectorAll`, `appendChild`, `removeNode`, `destroyNode`, and `setInnerHTML`,
 - Removed support for daemonizing the `batman` server tool.

Features

 - Add `Controller::handleError()`, `Controller::errorHandler()`, and `Controller.catchError` for regstering error handlers and wrapping callbacks to automatically handle errors coming back from async operations.
 - Remove `Model.lifecycle` (`Model::lifecycle` still exists) and switched to `loading` and `loaded` events instead so that multiple loads can occur at the same time.
 - Formalize error objects returned from `RestStorage`. eg, `UnprocessableEntityError` comes back from a `422` response. These error objects also have reference to the `env` for the operation as well as the `request`.
 - Allow `Model.persist` to take more than one object to mixin to the storage adapter.
 - Add `record.get('isDirty')` as a shortcut to check if a model is in the dirty state.

Bug Fixes

 - Make `hasMany` associations use the same sets before and after a record has an ID. (#537)
 - Make `belongsTo` associations replace the `proxy` object in the parent's property after the association is loaded.
 - Make `IteratorBinding` recover gracefully when the bound collection returns undefined for `toArray`.
 - Fix a bug in `EventBinding` where proxied values could cause non existant event handlers to fire causing browser errors.
 - Fix routing bugs surrounding regexp indexes in IE8.
 - Made `EventBinding`s not interfere with control or command clicks instead of calling the handler regardless of what modifier keys were pressed.
 - Fix underscoring in route names for nested member and collection routes. (#547)
 - Made filters which can't operate on null not operate on null.

## 0.12.0 (August 23rd, 2012)

Major Release

Breaking Changes:

 - Switch the interpretation of `Model.url` and `Model::url` to respect absolute and relative routes, and only in the case of relative routes prepend the `urlPrefix`.
 - Ensure that lifecycle events happen on models before validation takes place.

Features:

 - Add `Model.createFromJSON` as a shortcut for booting models from JSON and sticking them in the identity map
 - Add the `as` option to `Model.encode` which allows serialization into a key other than the key mentioned in `encode`
 - Add Rails style optional route segments with `()`
 - Add a `trim` filter
 - Give most validations the `allowBlank` option to force them to pass if the value is undefined or the empty string
 - Add an `AssociatedValidator` added by calling `Model.validate 'name', associated: true`
 - Make Controllers stop executing the rest of the action when a redirect occurs in a beforeFilter.
 - Add a `Proxy` class for proxying an object
 - Allow `EventEmitter::on` to take more than one key to attach a handler to

Bugfixes:

 - Fix a bug where radio buttons didn't quite work properly if their `value` HTML attributes were strings (#500)
 - Fix a bug where views would render when given a node regardless if their source was present or not. (#501)
 - Fix a bug with the pluralize filter not working correctly when passed "0" (#520)
 - Switch to not changing the URL in the address bar on 404s. (#524)
 - Fix a bug where redirecting during an existing redirect sequence would cause the oldest instead of the newest path to end up in the URL bar. (#536)
 - Ensure that lifecycle events happen on models before validation takes place.

## 0.11.2 (July 17th, 2012)

Really Minor Release

 - Add the association `extend` option to allow mixing in an object to an association Rails style

## 0.11.1 (July 11th, 2012)

Minor Release

 - Add Batman.DOM.querySelector and Batman.DOM.querySelectorAll helpers to wrap whatever methods are available for doing such things
 - Add the `key` an observer is on to the arguments passed to the observe
 - Switch the `or` filter to be a real boolean ||
 - Make the inferred view class a Controller checks for when rendering play nice with nested routing keys
 - Add the `encodeForeignKey` option to belongs to associations to allow disabling of the foreign key encoding.

Bugfixes:

 - Fix a race condition surrounding data-defineview sometimes causing views to be fetched from the server (#476)
 - Make autogenerated route names match the rest of the named routes generated (using . instead of CamelCaseing)
 - Fix Controller to allow operations to take place after an action without issue
 - Make the `default` filter check for both blank strings or non existing values
 - Fix model dirty tracking to really keep track of the clean value (#482)
 - Mark `AssociationSet`s as loaded if their parent is a new record and that parent is saved

## 0.11.0 (June 25th, 2012)

Minor Release (but it changes major node versions)

 - Improve `$setImmediate` performance on node
 - Remove the "bind to an object full of keys pointing to keypaths" functionality from `StyleBinding` due to complexity and underuse.
 - Add `Hash.meta.toArray` accessors and enumerability
 - Make `RestStorage` respect URLs passed to it in options, say, from `Model.Request`
 - Add `SetComplement` for getting a set of items in one set but not another. This *complements* SetIntersect and SetUnion quite nicely if you ask me.
 - Make `Set` use a user land quality test for membership checks. This means two objects which aren't `===` can define `isEqual` to return true and only one will end up in a `Set`.
 - Ensure records can save successfully after failing validation once before.
 - Rename `Object._objectID` to `Object._batmanID`
 - Remove `Batman.Request::cancel` and the extra `setImmediate` required for its implementation.
 - Add `data-insertif` and `data-removeif` bindings which downright remove nodes from the DOM instead of CSS'ing them away.
 - Make the automatic application of resource URLs on the server to Models no longer automatic and instead an option on the association macro
 - Add special behaviour for `params['#']` in controller actions to scroll to an element with that ID if it exists
 - Make Controller after filters run truely after the action's operations have completed. This is to say after render and DOM insertion.
 - Make `URI` mutable and add a `toString` to get back the URI string.
 - Allow view classes to declare they aren't cacheable.
 - Add a regexp validator accessible with `@validates 'foo', pattern: /foo/`
 - Give `ValidationError`s a `fullMessage` accessor which does the i18n stuff.
 - Add the `humanize` helper to `Batman.helpers` and to `Batman.Filters`

Bugfixes:

 - Prevent unloaded but autoloading associations from autoloading during encoding.
 - Fix dirtyKey tracking when the value is set to `null` or `undefined` after having an initial value.
 - Properly propagate changes into JS land when text is pasted into inputs when supported by browsers.
 - Make `currentURL`, `currentRoute` and `currentParams` available during beforeFilters.
 - Fix the generators to a) work and b) generate more modern code.
 - Fix a bug in the `HasManyAssociation` decoder which could result in duplicate entries being added to the identity map when nested associations were decoded.

## 0.10.0 (May 30th, 2012)

Major Release

 - Refactor StateMachine class to be its own class with transitions, callbacks, and predicates
 - Reimplement the Model lifecycle as a StateMachine residing at .get('lifecycle')
 - Implement load pipelining to multiplex multiple `load` calls to the same outgoing request if a second call is issued while a first is pending
 - Add the `@option` class macro to Views to allow the declaration of `data-view-myargument="keypath"` argument passing to custom views

 - Add a `RenderCache` clas which will cache major views rendered by `Controller::render`
 - Make `Controller` use previously rendered views from the `RenderCache` instead of rendering new ones
 - Remove the ability for views to be "container nodes". Views now have one root node always.
 - Make View insertion and removal indempotent, including with regards to yields. This means that if a view is removed from the DOM, it will retract nodes yielded elsewhere, and when reinserted, it will reinsert those yields into contentfors.
 - Add `View::inInDOM()` to ask a view if it is currently in the DOM or not, which indicates if it is safe to destroy.
 - Add behaviour to `SelectBinding` to update the JS land value with the first selected option if no JS land value was present.
 - Add `SetIndex#forEach` for looping over sets corresponding to particular values.
 - Add `Controller#executeAction` for executing other actions within a parent action
 - Add `Enumerable#inGroupsOf` for getting an enumerable partitioned into groups of a particular length
 - Make `Batman.helpers.pluralize` act more like the Rails version and not include the count when called in JS land.
 - Expose `RestStorageAdapter`'s environment allowing access to the meta information surrounding a request.
 - Move `Paginator` into an extra so people not using don't pay the filesize penalty
 - Remove unimplemented ability to have multiple storage adapters on Models.
 - Add `get`, `put`, `post`, and `delete` actions to `RestStorage` for doing "non-standard" requests while still using the nice request adapter pipeline
 - Add `Model.request` for sending nonstandard requests instead of having to use raw `Batman.Request`s
 - Add ability for `NamedRouteQuery` to accept arguments which aren't full objects and are the value of the params. "data-route='routes.customers[1]' instead of "data-route='routes.customers[customer]'"
 - Add the `$extend` helper, which is a lightweight `$mixin` which doesn't use `set`.
 - Add ability to not include the count in the `pluralize` helper
 - Add minification saftey warnings and the requirement for `resourceName` to be defined on Model subclasses and `routingKey` to be defined on Controller subclasses
 - Add the `isNew` accessor to Models
 - Add a Batman.URI class
 - Add node v0.7 compatibility and remove v0.4 compatibility
 - Unified params serialization to use `Batman.URI.paramsFromQuery`
 - Let the implicit `@render` call in controller actions be configurable via `Controller::defaultRenderYield`
 - Add `observeOnce` for observing a property change and then immediately removing the observer after the first time it fires.
